The suggested idea aims to colourize CCTV footage and photos captured during negative incidents. It entails applying sophisticated computer vision algorithms, particularly the Faster R-CNN algorithm, to identify and categorise items in a picture before colouring them to provide a more accurate depiction of the surroundings. The project begins with the gathering of a sizable dataset of CCTV footage and photos captured in black and white amid unfavourable circumstances, such as poor lighting or inclement weather. After that, the dataset is preprocessed to get rid of any noise and artefacts that can make the object identification and colorization models less effective. Following best practises, the preprocessed dataset is then divided into training, validation, and testing sets. The state-of-the-art object identification framework Faster R-CNN employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) to create region suggestions and forecast object classes and bounding boxes as the foundation for the proposed model architecture. A region proposal network (RPN), two sister networks, and a backbone network—typically a pre-trained ResNet or VGG network—follow to categorise item suggestions and improve their bounding boxes, respectively. A different deep learning model based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is trained on a collection of coloured photographs to colourize the discovered items. To produce colour forecasts for the items seen in the black and white photos, a colorization model is applied. The related items in the simulation are then given the expected colours. The suggested model is trained twice during the process. The black and white CCTV footage and picture dataset are used to train the Faster R-CNN object detection model in the initial step. The goal is to develop accurate item detection and classification skills. The colorization model is trained on a sizable dataset of coloured pictures in the second step. The goal is to develop accurate colour forecasts for items that the Faster R-CNN model has discovered. Standard performance indicators including accuracy, recall, and F1 score are used to assess the suggested model's effectiveness. According to the results, the suggested model can colourize black-and-white CCTV footage and photographs properly and effectively, giving a more detailed portrayal. In conclusion, the suggested approach seeks to solve the issue of colouring CCTV video and photographs captured during unfavourable incidents. The Faster R-CNN algorithm, a cutting-edge object identification framework, and a deep learning model based on CNNs for colorization are the foundations of the suggested model. The suggested model has the ability to give a more accurate depiction of the surrounding area and raise operators' situational awareness.
